### Markov Model

#### Overview

The Markov Model implemented in SeqLab is a first-order Markov Model. This model assumes that the probability of transitioning to a subsequent state depends solely on the current state. This approach simplifies the modeling of sequential data by considering only the immediate previous state for predicting the next state.

#### Theory

The transition probabilities are represented in a transition matrix \( P \), where each element \( P_{ij} \) denotes the probability of moving from state \( i \) to state \( j \). These probabilities are calculated as:

\[ P_{ij} = \frac{N_{ij}}{\sum_{k} N_{ik}} \]

where:
- \( N_{ij} \) is the number of transitions from state \( i \) to state \( j \).
- \( \sum_{k} N_{ik} \) is the total number of transitions from state \( i \) to any state.

To ensure robustness and handle cases with zero transitions, a smoothing parameter \( \alpha \) is introduced. The adjusted transition probabilities are then calculated as:

\[ P_{ij} = \frac{N_{ij} + \alpha}{\sum_{k} (N_{ik} + \alpha)} \]

#### Data Encoding and Training

1. **Data Encoding**: The states (or categories) are encoded based on the provided vocabulary. Each sequence in the training data is a series of these encoded states.

2. **Transition Matrix Construction**: During training, the model constructs a transition matrix by counting the occurrences of each transition between states in the training sequences.

3. **Smoothing**: The model applies the smoothing parameter \( \alpha \) to ensure that every possible transition has a nonzero probability, enhancing the model's robustness to unseen transitions.

4. **Normalization**: The transition counts are normalized to produce valid probabilities, ensuring that the sum of probabilities from any given state to all possible next states equals 1.

#### Prediction

For a given sequence, the model predicts the next state by:
1. Identifying the current state (the last state in the sequence).
2. Using the transition matrix to determine the probabilities of transitioning to each possible next state.
3. Selecting the next state based on these probabilities, often using techniques like random sampling weighted by the transition probabilities.

#### Model Persistence

The Markov Model in SeqLab supports saving and loading to facilitate persistence and reuse:
- **Saving**: The model's state, including the transition matrix and configuration, is saved to a file.
- **Loading**: A saved model can be loaded back, restoring the transition matrix and configuration for further use.

#### Example Configuration

Here is an example configuration for using the Markov Model in SeqLab:

```json
{
  "name": "MarkovModel",
  "epochs": 1,
  "optimization_config": {
    "alpha": {"min": 1e-5, "max": 1.0}
  }
}
```
